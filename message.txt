I reject the mayor's budget and instead support a redirection of funds back into the community. We don't need more police! Call an emergency city council meeting and deny the mayor's budget in favor of services over policing and support the People's Budget as a blueprint.

I would like to see more funds go towards helping the people, children, and families of Los Angeles, in areas like health, education, housing, and resources for small businesses and the arts - especially given the pandemic.

The time to act is now. We will be watching.
